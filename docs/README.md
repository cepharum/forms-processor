# Forms Processor

Forms Processor is a tool for managing a sequence of forms presented in browser for gathering information from a user. It relies on a structural description of forms supporting enhanced features such as fields depending on each other. All gathered input data can be processed e.g. by sending it to some remote server eventually.

Using a pre-built release via CDN Forms Processor can be easily injected into any HTML document. In addition it supports customizations by adding your own types of form fields as well as custom input data processors.
