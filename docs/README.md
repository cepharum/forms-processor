# Forms Processor

The FormsProcessor is a tool managing a sequence of one or more forms in browser gathering information from a user. It relies on a structural description of forms supporting enhanced features such as fields depending on each other. All gathered input data can be processed e.g. by sending it to some remote server eventually.

It can be easily injected into any HTML document. It supports customizations by adding your own types of form fields as well as input data processors.
