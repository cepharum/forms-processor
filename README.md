# forms-processor

> client application processing forms descriptions for gathering information

This library relies on VueJS using its CLI v3.

The forms processor is a toolkit for processing customizable sequences of forms each consisting of different kinds of input controls for gathering any kind of information. The processor itself is highly customizable and extensible. The processor relies on a description of forms provided in JSON format. This description supports linking values of one field with definition properties of another.

There is a [built version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forms-processor-browser) available for injection into your own application or website.
